This repository contains a full game of Break Out! (also called Bounce).
The game is played by using the A and D keys to move the paddle on the bottom
to the left or to the right in order to bounce the ball back up on the screen
in order to hit and destroy the bricks. If the ball falls below the screen,
the player loses a life. If all of the bricks on the screen are destroyed, the
player either moves on to the next level or wins the game. If 3 lives are lost, 
the player loses the game.

The cheat codes for warping to different levels are the key 1 for level 1,
2 for level 2, and 3 for level 3.

I changed this project by fixing the ball's collision physics, adding the
paddle and changing the direction of the ball based on where it was hit on the 
paddle, added the bricks that can be destroyed, created the three levels with 
harder-to-break bricks and a faster ball, cheat codes to warp to different levels,
and custom images, sounds, and screens.

The external resources that I used for images were found on Google Images (filtered

freesounds.com.
